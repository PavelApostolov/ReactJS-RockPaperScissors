The task was to make a simple and clear application for Rock-paper-scissors game. In the beginning I thought of what possible components the app will have and about the main logic of the game.

I couldn't resist to include some features that I find helpful (scoreboard, score history, restart button). Finally, I applied some styling and added some tests. 

In the future I can add yet another features (for example, options for how many rounds the game should last or how many points the winner should have) and improve the styling.
