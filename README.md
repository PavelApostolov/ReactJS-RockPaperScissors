This is a simple ReactJS application for playing Rock-paper-scissors against the computer. You can check your results at the scoreboard and the score history. You have the option to restart the game at any time.

Good luck!

# About the project
The task was to make a simple and clear application for Rock-paper-scissors game. In the beginning I thought of what possible components the app will have and about the main logic of the game.

I've tried several reusable components and I couldn't resist to include some features that I find helpful (scoreboard, score history, restart button). 
Finally, I applied some styling and added some tests. 

# To do
In the future I can add yet another features (for example, options for how many rounds the game should last or how many points the winner should have) and improve the styling. The application can be refactored with Redux but now it is an overkill.
